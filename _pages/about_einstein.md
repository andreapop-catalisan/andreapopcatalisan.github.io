Welcome to my website!

I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at the [Paris School of Economics (PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/). I completed my masterâ€™s and bachelor's degrees at University Carlos III of Madrid. My research interests are mainly in family, labor and gender economics.

Previously, I worked as a Research Analyst at the European Central Bank at DG Economics and DG Research. I also completed a pre-doc at the Barcelona School of Economics/UPF and worked as a Research Assistant at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy and the Bank of Spain.
